				<p >Hello, my name,as it says at the top of the screen, is Donald DiJacklin, and I am a wannabe data scientist. I made this site, from scratch, in part to demonstrate my, somewhat pathetic, website design skills, and in part to give people a convenient place to find out all about me, while easily finding all my relevant links, such as my LinkedIn profile, and my GitHub account. I would like to apologize for my, probably, inappropriate use of commas as I've never quite mastered them. If, for any reason, you feel the need to file a complaint, you should probably go to the Contact Me tab, in the Nav-bar.<br>
				I got into data science, because I really love to play with numbers (That's why I am a mathematics major at UCF), I enjoy coding, and I love trying to find solutions to new problems.<br>
				You might want a data scientist for many different reasons. In the technological world we live in currently, there is so much available information, that could be used to give your company a competitive edge. From helping you set price points, to making your various business processes more efficient, there are many possible avenues to improve your profits. <br>
